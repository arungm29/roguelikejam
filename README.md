# Forum at the Crossroads

## Premise

You're a traveler that arrives at the crossroads of a small village just before wintertime. The winters here are harsh and deadly, so you must ride out the worst of the season here. Traditionally the villagers will stock up before winter on the day of the great market at the crossroads, but the four lords that stock the stalls are feuding and none will attend if there is a chance the others will...

Without a bountiful market, the villagers won't survive the coming winter - and you won't, either! The villagers are each vassals to one lord or another, so they can't negotiate a compromise with the lords themselves. It's up to you, a stranger in their land with ties to no faction, to broker a truce before its too late.

## Basic Gameplay

* **Dialogue**: Learn the lord's greivances from their own mouths, and discover their omissions and clues to making peace by conversing with their subjects.
* **Fetch Quests**: Much of the conflict between lords is related to missing, misplaced, destroyed, or stolen persons and property. Find and return them to resolve disputes!
* **Race Against the Clock**: Winter waits for no one. The conclusion of the story depends on who comes to the market. 

## Wishlist

* day/night cycle
* map that updates as you explore
* a Jack-Frost-but-not-Jack-Frost character that makes his way across the map towards the crossroads. When he arrives, winter is here, and the game ends... better hope you have the lords on board before then!
* a "living" village with a cast of randomly generated characters to talk to 
* roaming knights to capture you and waste your time
* dungeons to escape from after you're captured
